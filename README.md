# fastlane-meet.mobile
Fastlane configuration presented on meet.mobile meeting in Wroclaw 2018

Appfile contains basic configuration, required for access Google Play API.
Fastfile is responsible for doing all the magic. It builds project, increments version, captures screenshots, upload all the stuff to the repository.

In real world it would be divided in more lanes, but it's just for a presentation - to show that all the pieces can work together.
